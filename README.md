# Frontend Mentor - Results summary component

This is my solution to the [Results summary component challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/results-summary-component-CE_K6s0maV).

This challenge was a bit tough to crack fast. I struggle a bit with responsive design and often find myself writing CSS too fast instead of carefully thinking about the relationships between parents and children. 

I didn't quite get everything right. There are some spacing issues that were a bit improvised, and I also found it challenging to get the gradient transition of the result circle just right.

There's a lot of room from improvement here, but I'm happy to have completed it nonetheless.
